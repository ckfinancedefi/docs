# Exchange

CK Finance is an Automated Market Maker (AMM), and the Exchange is at the heart of CK Finance. 

The CK Finance Exchange offers several features that support decentralized trading:

## Swapping/Trading

CK Finance lets users trade without the need to go through a Centralized Exchange. Everything you do on CK Finance is routed directly through your own walletâ€”no need to trust someone else with your coins!

## Liquidity Pools

You can only swap tokens on CK Finance if there is enough liquidity for those tokens. If nobody has added much liquidity for the token or tokens you want to swap, it will be difficult, expensive, or impossible to do so.

Providing liquidity will get you liquidity pool tokens, which will earn you rewards in the form of trading fees for making sure there's always liquidity for the exchange to use.
