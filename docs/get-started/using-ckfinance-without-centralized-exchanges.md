# Using CK Finance without Centralized Exchanges

You don't need an account with Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Huobi, OKEx or any other centralized exchange to start using CK Finance!

CK Finance is a decentralized application. That means, unlike Binance or other centralized platforms, you don't need to register account to use it... you just need a crypto wallet. So how can you get crypto onto CK Finance without using a centralized exchange?

In this tutorial, we're going to guide you through the process of using "cross-chain bridges" to transfer your assets into your BNB Smart Chain wallet, and start using CK Finance.

In the following tutorials, we are going to demonstrate moving USDT from a variety of different blockchains to BNB Smart Chain, using three different cross-chain bridges.
