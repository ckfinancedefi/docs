# Get BEP20 Tokens

The native tokens of BNB Smart Chain (BSC) are BEP20.

To do most things on BSC, you will need to pay gas, which comes in the form of BEP20 BNB.

You will also need the BEP20 version of any token you want to trade, stake etc. on BSC.

You can go a few ways about converting your tokens to BEP20.

- Binance
You can withdraw tokens as BEP20 via your Binance account (if you have one). Bear in mind you need an account to do so.

- SafePal
You don't need an account, or to register etc. Execute cross-chain swaps directly from your wallet.
