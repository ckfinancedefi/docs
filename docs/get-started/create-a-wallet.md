# Create a Wallet

To get started on CK Finance, the first thing you'll need is to set up a wallet that supports BNB Smart Chain (BSC). Wallets are available both on desktop computers and on smartphone devices. You'll need to choose the wallet that fits your needs best.

## When you're setting up a wallet, be sure to:
- ✅ Download and install only the latest version from an official source.
- ✅ Follow the setup guide carefully.
- ✅ Safely back up your recovery phrases.
- ❌ NEVER share your recovery phrases with anyone, under any circumstances.
- ❌ NEVER input your recovery phrase to a website or app, other than your wallet app.

## Smartphone/Mobile or Desktop wallet?
Mobile device wallets and desktop-based wallets have different strengths and weaknesses. Consider which fits your needs better to help decide which type of wallet to use.
