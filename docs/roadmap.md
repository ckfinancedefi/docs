# Roadmap

"Don't call it a roadmap"

## Finally, it's a roadmap not a to-do list.

Crypto moves fast, and we move fast too.

That means that we don’t publicly commit to specific timelines, so we can organize our development priorities based on market changes and developer resources.

Due to considerations of security and confidentiality, some items are not included in the ‘roadmap’ section.
