# Brand & Logos
Guidlines and downloadable assets like the CK Finance logo SVG

## Intro
CK Finance logo downloads are at the bottom of this page, but please be sure to read these guidelines first.

> Although CK Finance distributes some of its technology under open-source licenses, the CK Finance and CK brands are not distributed under the same licenses.

The following CK Finance "Brand Assets" are copyrighted material, and you may only use them in accordance with the policy detailed below:

- The CK Finance and CK logos, wordmark, icon
- The CK Finance name
- Other visual assets produced by CK Finance including but not limited to illustrations and 3d models

## What you may do
You may use CK Finance's Brand Assets when you are:

- Referring to our products and services
- Linking to our official site or products, such as "Trade our token on CK Finance"
- Announcing an official partnership, but only if you have official approval by a qualified member of the CK Finance team

For information on other uses of our Brand Assets, please reach out at info@ck.app

## What you may not do
While we strongly believe in and follow the open source ethos, protecting the CK Finance brand is extremely important for our users' security, so that users know what is a genuine product/endorsement and what isn't.

Here are a few examples of forbidden uses of our Brand Assets:
- Don't use our Brand Assets in your products' name, logo, NFTs, etc. 
- - For example, making an app called "CK Finance Engine" or "CK Super" are not allowed.
- - Don't use the CK Finance logo in whole or in part as part of your products' logos, marketing material, website, or other.
- - Logos with a strong resemblence to the CK Finance Icon are also forbidden.
- Don't use our Brand Assets to create digital or physcial products for sale, including but not limited to
- - Merchandise (Swag)
- - NFTs
- - Other products
- Don't create derivative names that imply official endorsement
For example, don't make a social media group called "CK Finance England" - this sounds official. "CK Finance Fans of England" may be permitted.
- Don't change or adapt our Brand Assets in any way
Use the logos and other assets exactly as provided. Do not change the colors, reassemble, abbreviate, or change these assets in any way.

Use your common sense and creativity. If you want to make something relating to the CK Finance ecosystem, make it your own.

Have fun making a unique brand that's clearly yours -- if your product is strong, you won't need to rely on remixing CK Finance's brand.
