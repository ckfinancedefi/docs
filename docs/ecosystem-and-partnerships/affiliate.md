# Affiliate Program

CK Finance’s Affiliate Program is designed to reward those who continue to help expand the community and share our product. The program will be available at the start to a select group of CK Finance advocates, and the CK Team plans to roll it out to more users. As an affiliate, you'll be part of a network of like-minded individuals committed to building a stronger DeFi community.

## Becoming an Affiliate

Becoming an affiliate is easy. All you need to do is visit our affiliate page, where you will find all the information you need to get started. Alternatively, you can fill out a google form. 

Once you’ve submitted your application, the CK Team will review your application and determine if you are a good fit for the program. This process may take some time, so please bear with us! If approved, we will reach out to you via your email or telegram.

If the CK Team approves your application, you will be granted access to the affiliate dashboard by connecting your wallet submitted in the program application. 

This dashboard will provide you with a range of tools and resources that you can use to share the protocol’s products or services and track your commission.

Once you can access the dashboard, you can create affiliate links to share with your community. You will earn a commission when a new user clicks on your affiliate link and makes a specific transaction. Ensure you always use your affiliate link when sharing your love for CK Finance!
